Decision Tree DV - Indiana Jones and the potentially locked door



Didn't manage to get this working, but Indiana Jones was supposed to come to an unlocked door, check if it was unlocked, and then open it and pass through.

Screencap shows what it would look like; scripts show what was supposed to happen (very few comments)
